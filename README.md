# ImageDocify
ImageDocify is a command-line program that quickly creates text documents from the names of images. It is a helpful tool for rapidly generating text documents with or without text that can be used for Ai image training.
How To Use
Step 1: Open a text editor such as Notepad. Copy and paste the code for the batch script from ImageDocify. Save the file with a .cmd extension (e.g., ImageDocify.cmd) to a desired location on your computer.
Step 3: Run the script and follow the directions on the terminal.

This program is intended for AI image generation and will only accept .png images. I recommend using TrainSizer in my repository to convert images to the correct size and format.
