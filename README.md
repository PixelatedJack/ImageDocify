# ImageDocify
ImageDocify is a command-line program that creates text documents from the names of images with ease. It is a useful tool for quickly generating text documents with or without text that can be used for Ai image training.

How To Use

Step 1: Open a text editor such as Notepad. Copy and paste the code for the batch script from ImageDocify. Save the file with a .cmd extension (e.g. ImageDocify.cmd) to a desired location on your computer.

Step 3: Run the script and follow the directions on the terminal.

***This program is intended for ai image generation and will only accept .png images. I highly recommend using TrainSizer located in my repository to convert images to the correct size and format.***
