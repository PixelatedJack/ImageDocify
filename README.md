ImageDocify

ImageDocify is a command-line program designed to quickly generate text documents from image file names. It is a valuable tool for rapidly creating text documents—with or without embedded text—that can be used for AI image training.

How to Use

Prepare the Script:
Open a text editor such as Notepad.
Copy and paste the batch script code from the ImageDocify repository.
Save the file with a .cmd extension (e.g., ImageDocify.cmd) in your desired location on your computer.
Run the Script:
Execute the script by double-clicking the .cmd file.
Follow the on-screen instructions provided in the terminal.
Note: This program is intended for AI image generation and accepts only .png images. It is recommended to use TrainSizer from my repository to convert images to the correct size and format.
